explaination
1. Basing on the final graph, I think using petal will perform better at seperating, because in figure 1, virginica and versicolor are mixed together and seldom occurs in figure 2.

2.The advantages for using log are:
1) Many distribution is log distribution, so we can notice the inner connection.
2) Decease the blank area and the number difference in the axile will be much smaller. Save space to display the graph.
